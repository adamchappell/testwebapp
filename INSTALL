excanvas.js: support routines for HTML5 canvas on IE8
RGraph.*: from Richard Heyes’ excellent RGraph Javascript graphing library: http://www.rgraph.net/
testserver.js: main server app
index.html: main client app

To run, ensure you have node.js installed, and use npm to install socket.io

$ npm install socket.io

To run the server app, modify the connect() line in index.html so that
it refers to your externally available name.

Then either:
- modify testserver.js to listen on port 80 (at the bottom), or
- use something similar to the included OpenBSD pf.conf to have tcp/80
  delivered to testserver.js’s tcp/8080

Have the UNIX shell start a while loop to execute the server
(since it will automatically exit approximately every 20 minutes.
Specify, on the server command line, the files explicitly permitted
to be served by HTTP. Eg.
$ chmod u+x testserver.js
$ while ./testserver.js index.html RGraph.* excanvas.js ; do sleep 30 ; done
